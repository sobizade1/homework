Think less zoomies, more focused bursts of playful energy.\n",

While he'd still enjoy games of fetch and tug-of-war, he might also show increasing interest in more complex activities like scent work, agility training, or even canine sports.  Socialization would remain important, and he'd probably enjoy interacting with both canine and human friends.  He might also develop stronger preferences for certain toys or activities.\n",

While still prone to occasional silliness, his behavior should be more predictable and less prone to impulsive destructive behaviors.  However, this is also the age where some dogs might start testing boundaries, particularly if they haven't received consistent training.  He might also develop some individual quirks or preferences in terms of his personality and habits.  He might be showing more independence, but still wanting his human's attention and affection.\n",

            "\n",
            "Denis Villeneuve's 'Arrival' isn't just a science fiction film; it's a profound meditation on time, communication, and the human experience.  The narrative unfolds with a deliberate pace, mirroring the painstaking process of deciphering the alien language and understanding the intentions of the heptapods, colossal, enigmatic creatures who have landed on Earth.  Amy Adams delivers a captivating performance as Dr. Louise Banks, a linguist recruited to unravel the mysteries of their complex, circular script.\n",
            "\n",
            "The film's strength lies not in explosive action sequences, but in the intricate interplay of language, memory, and perception.  The heptapod's logographic communication system, visualized with stunning visual effects, becomes a key to unlocking a non-linear perception of time, challenging the audience's understanding of causality.  This unconventional approach to storytelling is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally resonant.  The film subtly weaves together the personal and the universal, exploring Louise's complex relationship with her daughter in the context of a global crisis.\n",
            "\n",
            "While some might find the pacing slow, it serves to build suspense and allow the audience to fully immerse themselves in the complex themes.  The film's ambiguity, rather than being a weakness, is a strength, forcing viewers to grapple with the implications of the narrative long after the credits roll.  The emotional weight of Louise's choices, and the film's masterful exploration of free will versus determinism, leaves a lasting impact.\n",
            "\n",
            "Technically, 'Arrival' is impeccable.  The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing both the immensity of the alien vessels and the intimacy of Louise's personal struggles.  Jóhann Jóhannsson's haunting score perfectly complements the film's mood, adding layers of emotional depth.  'Arrival' is a cinematic masterpiece, a thought-provoking and beautifully crafted film that transcends the typical science fiction tropes to offer a truly unique and unforgettable experience.\n",
